Wind Power</h3>
<p>
Wind power is a form of renewable energy that generates electricity by using wind turbines, which are large, vertical structures with blades that rotate in the wind, converting the kinetic energy into mechanical energy, which is then converted into electricity.
Wind power is a clean and renewable energy source and does not produce greenhouse gas emissions or other pollutants during operation.</p>
